        <p class="para1">It is no surprise that intellectual growth and development are at the heart of a Seattle University education. Challenging students to think critically and broadly will happen in all disciplines. We expect students to be stretched by the faculty
            and the curriculum. After all, they are here for nothing less! Seattle University offers many types of academic support services and resources to guide and assist students as they progress through their university education. These services
            grow from our care for each student and our commitment to excellence in learning.</p>

        <p class="para1">It is our intention to challenge each student to stretch as far as possible and to support them as they strive to meet the challenges. Adjusting to the academic environment can be of special concern to some students and of great worry to many
            parents. College coursework is more challenging, and it is not uncommon for grades to slip a bit. Students who did well in high school with very little work may find that they need to "really" study in order to do well.</p>

        <p class="para1">It can also take some time to learn how to balance academic and social life. If students are struggling, various academic support resources on campus can help them get the assistance they need. The first of these resources, of course, is the faculty
            who are committed to teaching as well as to scholarship. One of the most important steps students can take for enriching their education at Seattle University is to get to know the professors of their courses.</p>

        <p class="para1">Faculty can help students with the course material and can refer them to campus resources for assistance when appropriate. Many of the faculty also serve as academic advisers. Advisers guide students in planning their program of studies, assist
            them in choosing classes and mentor them in the practices of their discipline. Specialized advisers are available through the Bellarmine Advising Center for students who have not declared a major or who are having academic difficulty.</p>

        <p class="para1">Other support services are available as well, all at no cost to the student. The Loyola Learning Center offers peer tutors in many subjects, professional study skill consultations, workshops on academic success topics, and facilitated study groups
            supplemental to classes that students commonly find difficult. The Writing Center provides peer consultation on writing projects at any step in the process. The Mathematics, Computer Science and Accounting Departments all offer drop-in homework
            assistance for student in their classes. The Family Educational Privacy Act (FERPA) is a law that protects students' academic records from any third party without written consent from the student.</p>

        <p class="para1">One exception to this law is what is considered to be directory information. According to FERPA, directory information can be released to anyone without the consent of the student. Seattle University considers directory information to be; student
            name, campus address and phone (if any), SU email address, major field of study, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, grade level, enrollment status (i.e., full-time, part-time, undergraduate, graduate), name of the most recent
            previous educational institution attended, participation in official activities or sports, the weight and height of members of athletic teams, and photographs (but for University use only).</p>
